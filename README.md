# TradingClone

The initial portion of this project was to design a platform by which the user can make trades on cryptocurrencies through Binance.
Currently, the platform is being extended to include multiple brokerages and securities, as well as implement algorithmic trading and high frequency trading
support. The objective is to make a platform on which a user can design and implement their own algorithmic trading strategies on any asset with live feed
information for the selected security and brokerage. Additionally, we seek to incorporate some of the latest deep learning models for algorithmic asset trading.

The work here is just raw code for the project which encompasses about 1 month of off and on development
with a team. There are a few known bugs to squash, and a number of optimizations to make.

My partner was fine with sending over the code, the concern was just to make sure that no personal information or actual trading strategies were passed along.
(He's quite protective of his trading strategies, and not without good reason.)
